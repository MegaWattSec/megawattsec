This level presents you with several articles from an old ezine about perl hacking.

The page script &#8220;/index.pl&#8221; is what&#8217;s processing our selection. Here it is in Burp Suite:

### Objective 1 &#8211; sourcecode

I read some of the ezine issues and tried a few things to the input for &#8220;index.pl&#8221;. Eventually figured out that the trick is [perl piping](https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl3/prog/ch16_03.htm). The documentation says

> &#8220;Perl&#8217;s <tt class="literal">open</tt> function opens a pipe instead of a file when you append or prepend a pipe symbol to the second argument to <tt class="literal">open</tt>. This turns the rest of the arguments into a command, which will be interpreted as a process (or set of processes) that you want to pipe a stream of data either into or out of. &#8220;

Given the insight that [piping can lead to command injection](https://nets.ec/Command_Injection#Perl), all we should have to do is add &#8220;&#124;&#8221; to the beginning of the &#8220;file&#8221; variable and then we have total control! My first goal is to get the source for &#8220;index.pl&#8221; since the page doesn&#8217;t give us the link for it. `?file=|cat+index.pl` should work. But that alone doesn&#8217;t get anything.

The clue here is the &#8220;file&#8221; variable itself. The script is looking up a file, but there&#8217;s no extension on it, which could mean the extension is being forced. [Null byte injection](http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246949/Null%20Byte%20Injection) is how to solve that issue.

Trying `?file=|cat+index.pl%00` works!

### Objective 2 &#8211; password

Of course the first thing to try would be `?file=|cat+/etc/natas_webpass/natas30%00`, but that doesn&#8217;t work! Surprise! We only get a &#8220;meeeeeep!&#8221; close to the end of the page.

Looking in the source shows the culprit:

{% highlight perl %}if($f=~/natas/){
    print "meeeeeep!&lt;br&gt;";
}
{% endhighlight %}

It&#8217;s a simple word filter, and there are a few tricks to getting around those.

  1. [Single Character Wildcard](https://medium.com/secjuice/waf-evasion-techniques-718026d693d8) &#8211; The question mark is as wildcard for a single character in the Bash shell.
  2. [Concatenated Strings](https://medium.com/secjuice/web-application-firewall-waf-evasion-techniques-2-125995f3e7b0) &#8211; In Bash, there is something called string literal concatenation, meaning that adjacent string literals are concatenated, without any operator. An example would be <code class="lt mr ms mt mu b">"Hello, ""World"</code> which has the value <code class="lt mr ms mt mu b">"Hello, World"</code>.

Some examples of strings to use for the &#8220;file&#8221; variable:

  1. `|cat+/etc/na?as_webpass/na?as30%00`
  2. `|cat+???/etc/na???tas_webpass/nat???as???30%00`

Using either of these will show the password at the bottom of the response HTML.
